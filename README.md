axmldec: Android Binary XML Decoder
===================================

## 1 Overview

[`AndroidManifest.xml`][Android App Manifest] in an [APK file][APK] is binary
encoded. This tool accepts either a binary or a text XML file and prints the
decoded XML to the standard output or a file. It also allows you to extract the
decoded `AndroidManifest.xml` directly from an APK file.

Tools such as [Apktool] are designed to process the whole APK file including
the resource files for reverse engineering purpose. They may also need a Java
virtual machine to run. As a result, they are too slow for batch processing
many APK files just to get the XML information. In contrast, axmldec is
specialized for binary XML decoding and written in simple modern C++, so it
runs nicely within a shell script.

The [parser](include/jitana/util/axml_parser.hpp) is taken from [Jitana], a
graph-based static-dynamic hybrid DEX code analysis tool. You can use
`jitana::read_axml()` instead of the standard
`boost::property_tree::read_xml()` to read a binary XML file into
`boost::property_tree::ptree` ([Boost Property Tree][ptree]) in your C++
program.

## 2 Installation

### 2.1 macOS

You can install axmldec using [Homebrew]:
```sh
brew tap ytsutano/toolbox
brew install axmldec
```

Or, download the binary from [Releases].

### 2.2 Windows

Download the .exe file from [Releases].

### 2.3 Linux

Build the tool from the source code (see below).

## 3 Usage

### 3.1 Decoding `AndroidManifest.xml`

Pass the manifest file (either binary or text) to decode:
```sh
axmldec -o output.xml AndroidManifest.xml
```

This will write the decoded XML to `output.xml`. You can specify the same
filename for input and output to decode the file in-place.

### 3.2 Decoding `AndroidManifest.xml` in an APK File

If an APK file is specified, axmldec automatically extracts and decodes
`AndroidManifest.xml`:
```sh
axmldec -o output.xml com.example.app.apk
```

### 3.3 Using the Standard Output

axmldec writes to the standard output if the `-o` option is not specified. This
is useful when additional processing is required. For example, you can extract
the package name from an APK file using xmllint:
```sh
axmldec com.example.app.apk | xmllint --xpath 'string(/manifest/@package)' -
```

## 4 Building

1. Install Boost, zlib, and CMake. Make sure you have a latest C++ compiler.

2. Clone axmldec and its submodule from GitHub:
    ```sh
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/ytsutano/axmldec.git
    ```

3. Compile axmldec:
    ```sh
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release . && make
    ```


## 5 Building and Running with Docker

You can also build and run `axmldec` using Docker. This avoids having to install dependencies directly on your host machine.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    Navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run the following command:

    ```sh
    docker build -t axmldec .
    ```

2.  **Run the `axmldec` container:**
    Use `docker run` to execute the tool. You must mount a local directory containing your APK or `AndroidManifest.xml` file to the `/data` directory inside the container.

      * **To decode an `AndroidManifest.xml` file:**
        Replace `/path/to/your/files` with the absolute path to the directory containing your file.

        ```sh
        docker run --rm -v /path/to/your/files:/data axmldec -o /data/output.xml /data/AndroidManifest.xml
        ```

      * **To decode an APK file:**

        ```sh
        docker run --rm -v /path/to/your/files:/data axmldec -o /data/output.xml /data/your-app.apk
        ```
